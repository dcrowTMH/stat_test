# stat_test

This repository is dedicated to developing statistical code for basic exploration and discovery of statistical properties in data and models. It covers various aspects of statistics, including statistical tests, time series data handling, and more.
AI-assisted code generation and data simulation are used to help deepen understanding of both concepts and practical applications.
Please feel free to submit requests or suggestions. I am also continuously learning and applying these topics to real-world scenarios in my job.
